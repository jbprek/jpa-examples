============================================

 - [Relationship Concepts](#CP)    
 - [Basic (Standard) Relationships](#SR)
 
 
##<a name="CP">Relationship Concepts</a>

- **Roles**  Employee **works** in a department who is **staffed** with employees. Role is the view of the relationships from either or both sides.
- **Directionality** Relationships can be uni or bi directional.
- **Cardinality** One to One, Many to Many or Many to One, * or 1 in UML diagram.
- **Ordinality** 1 or 0 in the UML diagram.
- **Ownership** The side who has the JOIN Column is the owner of the relationship, the other side is called the inverse side.
- **Single Value Association**
- **Collection Value Association** 


##<a name="SR">Standard Relationships</a>

The following describe the basic entity relationships, see more notes inside each project.

* [One to One unidirectional](#SRO2OU)
* [One to One bidirectional](#SRO2OB)   
* [Many to One](#SRM2O)
* [One to Many unidirectional](#SRO2MU)
* [One to Many bidirectional](#SRO2MB)   
* [Many to Many unidirectional](#SRM2MU)
* [Many to Many bidirectional](#SRM2MB)   


###1. **<a name="SRO2OU">One to One unidirectional</a>**, see package basic_relationship.one2one_si

    Relationship of Employee and ParkingLot:
    
       @Entity
       public class Appartement {
           @GeneratedValue
           @Id
           private long id;
       
           @Basic(optional = false)
           private String code;
       
           // optional attribute default=true
           @OneToOne()
           private ParkingLot parkingLot;
           
            //@JoinColumn(name = "PARKING_ID")
            private ParkingLotEntity phones;
            ...

        @Entity
        public class ParkingLot {
            @Id private long id;
            ...
#### Notes
    - Single Value Association
    - Owner is Employee
    - Sideffect :It's possible for two Appartments to refer to the same ParkingLot
    - 

    
###2.  <a name="SRO2OB">One to One bidirectional</a> , see project basic_relationship.one2one_bi 

    Relationship of Employee and ParkingLot again.  Parking differs from above.
    
    @Entity
    @Table(name="PARKING_LOT")
    public class ParkingLot{    
        @Id private long id;
        
        /* If mappedBy is removed then foreign keys are created on both tables */
        @OneToOne(mappedBy = "phones")
        private Employee employee;

    
    
###3. <a name="SRM2O">Many to One</a> , see project rel_many2one

    Relationship of Employee and Department.
    
    @Entity
    public class Employee {    
        @Id private long id;
        ...    
        @ManyToOne
        @JoinColumn(name = "DEPT_ID")
        
        
        @Entity
        public class Department {
            @Id private long id;

    
    
###4. <a name="SRO2MU">One to Many unidirectional</a>, see project rel_one2many_uni

    Relationship of Person and Phones
    
    
###5. <a name="SRO2MB">**One to Many bidirectional**</a> , see project rel_one2many_bi

    Relationship of Employee and Department again.
    
        @Entity
        public class Department {        
            @Id  private long id;
            ....
            @OneToMany(mappedBy="department")
            private List<Employee> employeesByAssignment = new ArrayList<>();

        @Entity
        public class Employee {        
            @Id private long id;
            ....
            /* OWNER SIDE*/
            @ManyToOne
            @JoinColumn(name = "DEPT_ID")
            private Department department;
    
    
    
###6. <a name="SRM2MU">Many to Many unidirectional</a>, see project rel_many2many_uni

###7. <a name="SRM2MU">**Many to Many bidirectional**</a> , see project basic_relationship.many2many_bi

    Relationship of Employee and Project.
    
        @Entity
        public class Employee {
            @Id  private long id;
            ...
            @ManyToMany
            @JoinTable(name = "EMPLOYEE_PROJECT", 
                joinColumns = @JoinColumn(name="EMPLOYEE_ID"), 
                inverseJoinColumns = @JoinColumn(name="PROJECT_ID"))
            private Set<Project> projects;
            
            
        @Entity
